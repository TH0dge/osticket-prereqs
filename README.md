Type in the search bar for "Virtual Machine" and click on it. Make sure to select the rescource group we just made. Give the machine a name, choose the same location as the recource group. Under the image section choose Windows 10 Pro. Next step is to choose what size or components the virtual machine will run off. I recomend at least the 2 cpu 16 memory. Click next for disk and network. It will automatically create a virtual network and subnet. Click review and create.
